<p>
I'm Florian, I'm 22 years old currently in my last year of Computer Science Engineering School at Polytech'Lyon and work, in parallel, as Freelancer. I'm a <b>back-end and front-end web developer</b>.
</p>
<p>
I work on a lot of side projects to stay tuned with the new technologies like <b>NodeJS</b> and new front-end tools like <b>Gulp or Bower</b>.
</p>
<p>
<b>As front-end developer</b>, I really like the possibility to create anything with just HTML/CSS/JS from some creative photoshop model.
</p>
<p>
<b>As back-end developer</b>, I like create complex algorithm which deals with large amount of data. Optimization is the key and my priority.
</p>
<p>
Happy owner of a Raspberry PI , I try to recreate <b>Jarvis at home</b>.
</p>
<p>
I have some mathematical backend with <b>the creation of a poker bot</b> (use of some neuronal network, bayesian network or complex algorithm simulation like CFR or MonteCarlo).
</p>
<p>
You could see my projects on my personal <a href="https://github.com/thatcheck">GitHub</a> or follow me on this website.

				<p>
					Findizer is a web application which allowing users to enjoy shopping services directly in their web browser. It can save your search, take some promotional code or discover the best product of the e-commerce.
				</p>
				<b>Mission 1 :</b> Launch the V3
				<p>
					Change The technical architecture and the graphics architecture. I had worked a lot on the technical part to integrate the MVC pattern on the website.
				</p>
				<b>Technologies used :</b>
				<ul>
					<li> HTML5/CSS3/JS </li>
					<li> PHP/Mysql </li>
				</ul>
				<b>Mission 2 :</b> Web crawlers
				<p>
					To always have more products in the database, we need a continuous supply of products. And to accomplish that, we need platforms that pass us some formatted streams of hundreds different shops on the web.
					The stream is saved on the local webserver. The major problem was the size of stream. Because some of stream can make one giga-octet and contains more than 500 000 product, we need a strong, robust and timeless script to decode and save it in our database.
				</p>
				<b>Technologies used :</b>
				<ul>
					<li> PHP with gearman (to run mutliple instance of crawlers) </li>
					<li> Mysql with temporary table and bulk insert/update to optimize the response time of database. </li>
				</ul>

				<b>Mission 3 :</b> Url matching (Lot of work on the algortihm part)
				<p>
					The "web trends" flow should allow the user to find the most popular products currently on the web. To do this, we therefore need to analyze the navigation of each plugins and try to match with our existing product base.
					We had approximately 100,000 active plugins that sent us, every day, more than a million URLs sailed on various e-commerce sites. We decided to use these URLs, compare with URLS products in our database and calculate a flow of "web trends".
				</p>
				<b>Technologies used :</b>
				<ul>
					<li> PHP/Mysql</li>
				</ul>


				<b>Mission 4 :</b> Internet Explorer plugin
				<p>
					Findizer already has a plugin for Firefox and Google Chrome. But in order to offer its services to a maximum of user, it is essential to offer a version for Internet Explorer that is still heavily used in the world of web browsers.

<h3>Personal/Side projects</h3>
<p>
With my studies and my passion for the computing field, I have worked on a lot of side projects. You can see him below with short resume.
</p>

<p>
<b> Jarvis Raspberry : </b> This is currently my main side project. The ultimate goal of this project is to automate common tasks ( control lights , shutter, voice control , alarm, calendar or suggestion can I find useful) from scratch. So I develop the core components with <b>NodeJS</b>, use <b>C/C++</b> to program on micro-controller like ATMEGA328 and use <b>React</b> for the front-end interaction.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Taskizr : </b> My second main project. I try to use the uber' model for other task. I just develop currently the back-end of the application with <b>NodeJS</b> and looking for native dev in IOS and Android. But I thinking a lot about the possibility to develop the mobile application with <b>react native.</b>
</p>
<p>
	<b>Symfony Bundle : </b> I develop mainly two open source symfony bundle (and a lot more private) to deals with the Google API, Scrap Google Adword Result or deals with the Google Adword API.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Thatcheck : </b> A social network based on your "check" (facts). This site is not currently online. I use <b>Symfony</b> to develop it and HTML/CSS/JS for the front-end
</p>
<p>
	<b>Poker IA :</b> I developed a poker bot with <b>C#</b>. The bot use historical hands from a website, learn it with <b>bayesian network</b>, use <b>Case Based</b> reflexion to make decision and some simulation algorithm like <b>MonteCarlo</b> or <b>CFR</b> to simulate the hand strength.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Chess game :</b> A school project where I develop, in team, a Java Chess game with IA based on the MinMax Algorithm.
